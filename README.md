## Why This Repository Exists<a name = "why"></a>

This repository exists to contain my project for the module Theory Of Algorithms which shows how my explanation and attempt to solve three different problem using the programming language python, these problems consist of the:

- The Post Correspondence Problem
- The Bounded Post Correspondence Problem
- The Countdown Numbers Game

## What Is In It<a name = "what"></a>

- **countdown.ipynb, it contains the following**:
    - Overview and explanation of the Countdown Numbers Game
    - Discussion of the complexity of the Countdown Numbers Game
    - Python function, written in a functional programming style to solve a Countdown Numbers Game
    -  Explanation of the functional aspects of your code

- **post-correspondence.ipynb, it contains the following**:
    - Definition and explanation of the Post Correspondence Problem
    - Definition and explanation of the Bounded Post Correspondence Problem
    - Python function to solve the Bounded Post Correspondence Problem.
    - Explanation of what an undecidable problem is in computability theory, with reference to the Post Correspondence Problem.
    
- **README.md, it contains the following**:
    - Explanation on for what purpose this repository exists
    - Explanation on what is the contents in this repository
    - Explanation on how to run the notebooks in the repository

## How To Run The Notebook<a name = "how"></a>

1) Download [Anaconda]().
2) Download [cmder]() if on Windows.
3) Ensure that git is installed.
4) Create a blank folder in your cmder.
5) Navigate into a selected directory, using the command:
```bash
cd 'your_directory'
```
6) Clone the repository, using the command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Emmanuel-Osabuehien/TheoryOfAlgorithmsProject
```
7) Naviagte into the repository folder, using the command:
```bash
cd TheoryOfAlgorithmsProject
```
8) Deploy the notebooks on your browser, using the command:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```
9) Jupyter should run in browser, if not the localhost address should be provided in the command prompt where you can copy and paste into your required search engine.
10) You can restart and run all cells in either the 'countdown.ipynb' or 'post-correspondence.ipynb' notebooks.

<p> System requirements that are needed to run the project includes: </p>

- Python 3.9
- Git
- Cmder
- WSL2
