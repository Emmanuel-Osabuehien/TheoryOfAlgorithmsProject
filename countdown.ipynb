    "The Countdown Numbers Game is a popular arithmetical puzzle which has been played as a two-player game on French\n",
    "and British television weekly for decades.\n",
    "\n",
    "The contestant decides how many large numbers are to be used, from none to all four, after which the six tiles are randomly drawn and placed on the board. A random three-digit target number is then generated. The contestants have 30 seconds to work out a sequence of calculations with the numbers whose final result is as close to the target number as possible. They may use only the four basic operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division, and do not have to use all six numbers and a number may not be used more times than it appears on the board.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Six numbers are selected at random.\n",
    "- These numbers are generated in two groups, small numbers and large numbers.\n",
    "- Typically, the large numbers are between (25, 50, 75, 100)\n",
    "- There are twenty numbers in the small set, two each of the numbers 1-10\n",
    "- A random three-digit target number is also generated by the computer\n",
    "- The user is then expected to get as close as possible to the chosen target by using just the four basic arithmetic operators (+, -, ร, รท)\n",
    "- But not all the digits need to be used.\n",
    "- Concatenation of the digits is not allowed, for example you can't use 3 and 4 to make 34\n",
    "- At no point in the process can the current running total become negative or involve a fraction\n",
    "- Each number can only be used once in the calculation"
